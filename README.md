# 🚗 Computer Graphics Project - A.Y. 2023/2024

Our project for the Computer Graphics course at Politecnico di Milano is a simple videogame developed using **Vulkan** and **glm**, featuring a fast-paced racing game where players compete to finish a challenging circuit in the shortest time possible while collecting coins to maximize their score. Designed with extendability in mind, this project is a showcase of several rendering techniques, real-time physics, and audio effects.

## 🏁 **Game Features**

- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Race against time and gather coins to boost your score.
- **Realistic Physics**: Powered by **Bullet Physics**, the car's movement and collision responses are lifelike.
- **Stunning Visuals**: 
  - Ambient lighting sets the tone for a brightful gameplay.
  - Spotlights and point lights simulate dynamic light diffusion and reflection.
- **Immersive Audio**: Integrated **FMOD** brings immersive sound effects and background music.
- **Custom and Community Assets**:
  - Many 3D models crafted with care in **Blender**.
  - Additional assets sourced from the community and provided by the university course professor.
